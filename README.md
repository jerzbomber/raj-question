# Raj Sample Solution

This project is one way to solve the following:

*Given an array of transactions, want to return similar array
with some added info. Eliminates the need to call functions
more than once in map and makes use of the object spread option
(Stage 2 proposal for ECMAScript but currently being used in production
in projects such as React Native). You must use a transpiler in order
to use it so I am using Babel to transpile my project.*

## Installing

```sh
npm install
```

## Building

```sh
npm run build
```

## Documentation

Pay special attention to the following files:

* **package.json** - devDependencies section
* **.babelrc** - note the transform-object-rest-spread plugin
* **example.js** - read through the comments
